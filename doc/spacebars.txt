I'm trying to understand what different types of spacebars there are out there.

15 keys wide is 285mm. This makes 19mm spacing each for 15 keys (the key itself
is a little shorter, like 1mm shorter for the gap between keys).

Let's first inventorize what I have.
All keys below are Cherry MX stems.

First 1U = 0.75in = 19.05mm

I've found a single type of 6u key:

  6u spacebar = 6 x 19.05mm = 114mm (112mm really, for gaps)
  -38mm, 0mm, +38mm or [-2u, 0u, +2u]

I've found a few types of 6.25u keys:

  "Standard" 6.25u spacebar = 119mm.
  -50mm,        0mm, +11.5mm,        +50mm or [-2.625u, 0u, 0.6u, 2.625u]

  "Universal" 6.25u spacebar = 119mm.
  -50mm, -38mm, 0mm, +11.5mm, +38mm, +50mm

I've found a single type of 7u key:

  7u spacebar = 132mm.
  -57mm, 0mm, +57mm or [-3u, 0u, +3u]
