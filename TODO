- Create alternatives for keyboards.

- Keyboard descriptions also have to have rows to match. So perhaps split up the
  row of the key descriptions from their stem, e.g. SA_R2 should be two fields,
  so that when we check for coverage we can take into account the row as well.

- Keyboard descriptions should have rows, so that they are easier to define.
  Assume each row moves by the size of its key, instead of having to provide
  each position.

- Rename Key -> Keycap.

- Keyboard layout name really ought to be called "layout".

- Should we distinguish between keyboards and layouts?

- How do we support the ISO key? What about its geometry? Do we just make it a
  special beast? Are they always all of the same shape?

- What about vertical keys? What about supporting something like the Ergodox?

- What about Switch brand? Cherry MX vs. Gateron vs. Zealios, vs. others. Do we
  really care? Nah. Probably an idea to put an option though, if we distinguish
  the entities of Keyboard and Layout.
